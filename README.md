# jamz-script

Just a little startup script I made so setup is less bad

Enables dark mode, sets background to user-input image, 
installs Discord and Spotify via Winget, installs Scoop,
and installs Nano and Git via Scoop.

Compatible with Windows 10 and 11. Will set dark mode and
background even on non-activated Windows.
